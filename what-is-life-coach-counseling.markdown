Life Coach Counseling is not psychotherapy as it does not address mental disorders as defined by the American Psychiatric Association. Psychotherapy is a healthcare service and its primary focus is to identify, diagnose and treat mental disorders. Life Coach Counseling is a collaborative process that is present and future oriented. It is action oriented, solution focused and encourages change. It involves accountability and commitment to growth through increased competence, commitment, and confidence. As a client, you participate in setting the agenda for sessions and your success will largely depend upon your willingness to define goals and try new approaches. You can expect Dr. Pepper, your Life Coach Counselor, to be honest and direct, asking straightforward questions and offering techniques to help you keep moving forward.
