Confidentiality is an important element of the life coach counseling process. Client’s identity and ongoing work will be kept strictly confidential. The nature of a life coach counselor and client relationship involves sharing personal information. There may be times when teens will be encouraged to share issues with their parents, and it is Dr. Pepper’s goal to keep parents informed of the general counseling process. However, unless permission is granted, all conversations, sessions, and written communications will remain confidential between Dr. Pepper and client, except where prohibited by law.
