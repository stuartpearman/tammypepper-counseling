- title: Why Would Teens Need Counseling?
  body: |-
    Childhood, especially during the stressful tween and teen years, is a time of dramatic change and growth when kids juggle conflicting messages and feelings while trying to connect to one another--and themselves--emotionally, creatively and socially.

    While today’s teens are more scheduled and pressured than ever, they are also coming of age in a world where setting aside time to teach and foster healthy human connections, creativity and self-knowledge has become more difficult to achieve. Life coach counseling guides teenagers to make positive changes so they can reach their fullest potential and gain the life they want.

      *"My parents divorced two years ago. It was very difficult for me to cope with all the changes taking place in my family. I felt lost and confused, and was pulling away from my friends and family. I couldn’t keep up with my homework and my grades were dropping. Dr. Pepper helped me to get along better with my parents after the divorce and to improve my grades and relationships with my friends."*

      *"I was bullied for years at school. Kids were so mean to me and called me horrible names. I was pushed into lockers and had my bookbag thrown down the stairway at school. I was afraid to tell my parents about what was happening and was afraid to go to school. Dr. Pepper helped me to learn ways to deal with the bullies and how to stand up for myself. I also feel better about myself and can talk more easily to my parents."*

      *"I was in a relationship with a guy who was pressuring me into doing things I didn’t want to do. I didn’t want him to break up with me, so I did some of the things he wanted. I didn’t feel good about the things I did and couldn’t talk to my mom about them. Dr. Pepper listened to me and helped me realize that I needed to value myself and to resist the pressure to do things that I didn’t really want to do. She was so easy to talk to and made me feel important."*

      *"I was a senior in high school and was confused about the direction I wanted to take following graduation. My parents wanted one thing for me, but I wanted something else. I wanted to be a graphic designer, but my parents wanted me to pursue something more challenging, like law or medical school. Dr. Pepper worked with me and my parents to establish a reasonable goal that both my parents and I felt comfortable with. I am now on a path that I am happy pursuing."*
