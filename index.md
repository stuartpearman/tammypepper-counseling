- title: Why Would Teens Need Counseling?
  body: |-
    Childhood, especially during the stressful tween and teen years, is a time of dramatic change and growth when kids juggle conflicting messages and feelings while trying to connect to one another--and themselves--emotionally, creatively and socially.

    While todayâ€™s teens are more scheduled and pressured than ever, they are also coming of age in a world where setting aside time to teach and foster healthy human connections, creativity and self-knowledge has become more difficult to achieve. Life coach counseling guides teenagers to make positive changes so they can reach their fullest potential and gain the life they want.
