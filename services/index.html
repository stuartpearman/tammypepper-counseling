Teen life coach counseling sessions typically take place twice per month, but weekly appointments are available. Each appointment will last for 50 minutes and the fee is very reasonable. A sliding fee scale is available. Please feel free to email Dr. Pepper about fees, scheduling appointments, or for any additional questions you may have.
